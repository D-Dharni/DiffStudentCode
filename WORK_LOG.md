| February 6 | 7:00-8:15pm  | I started this session by reviewing the slides for this problem. Mr.Blick hinted that the problem would involve using dynamic programming again. The core understanding of the problem is that you are trying to figure out what the longest substring is AND the substring ONLY has to be SUBSEQUENT. What I wanted to do for this session was to try and figure out what a brute force approach would look like. Basically, one way to solve it would be to generate every possible substring of document 1. To loop through those substrings. Then to check whether those substrings are in doc 2, and track the maximum length. I started to transfer this idea to pseudocode. You want to start with the max length, the loop, then check if its a subsequence, and return the max. For the if the substring is valid, I started to make pseudocode for the helper function. Basically, you would want to have a i for doc 1, a j for doc 2. While they are less than each other, check if they are equal if so increase one of the indexes conditionally and increase the other always. |

I started by thinking about what would happen if I just stuck myself in the middle of the problem as Mr.Blick recommends. At this point in the problem, I have some prefix from doc 1 and 2, and I'm at some index in doc 1 and 2. Now that I am looking at this point, I would look at the next character. Let's say the character matches. If it does, then I would extend off of whatever sequence I was already building. So I think at each position what I need to save is that for this specific position in each doc, what is the longest current sequence. If I think about it like that then I will have the optimal solutions to the smaller problem to make the optimal solution for the larger problem. There are still some issues though. I still don't fully understand what to do when they don't match, and I don't understand what kind of structure would be best for this. |
